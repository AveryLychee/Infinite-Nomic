- **1 § On The Constitution**

This rule is not referred to by a number, but is instead called "The Constitution".

Proposals to change, add or remove anything from The Constitution cannot be denied by the Leader or the Judges and can only be passed if at least 75% of the votes are in favour of the proposal.

If The Constitution is in conflict with another rule, The Constitution takes precedence. 


- **2 § On Proposals and Turn Order**

Players take turns adding a proposal to the game. A proposal can be changing an existing rule or shop item, deleting an existing rule or shop item, or making a completely new rule or shop item. Changing several parts of one rule (like The Constitution itself) counts as one proposal, but changing several shop items does not. You may only make 1 proposal on your turn.


- **3 § On Legislation**

The legislating process consists of four days, each day stretching from 17:00 CET one day to 17:00 the day after.

Every day, all @Current players lost their position and are placed last in #turns, then the next two players in #turns become the new @Current players. @Current players may make one proposal each time they are given the role by posting in #proposals. Types of proposals that skip certain aspects of the legislating process go directly to the next relevant step.

Each proposal submitted by this method shall be submitted to the Leader the day after it is submitted. During this day, the Leader must choose to accept or reject the proposal by writing so in the channel #leader. If the proposal is rejected, no more will come of it. If it is accepted by the Leader, the proposal shall go through the rest of the legislating process.

During the third day, the Judges must vote "Yay" or "Nay". Voting "Nay" consumes a "Nay" charge. The judge vote is submitted in the channel #judges. If both Judges vote "Nay", the current Leader's term ends at the end of the day, the change to the rules is not implemented, an election happens for a new Leader, and the Leader who lost their position loses 200 coins. If at least one Judge voted "Yay" on a proposal, it passes onto the final day of the legislating process.

At the beginning of the fourth day, a poll on whether each proposal should pass is posted to #voting. All players may vote on this poll. Players may only vote for or against proposals and, unless otherwise specified, may only submit 1 vote per proposal.

If there are more votes for than against a rule at the end of the fourth day, that rule is instantly put into effect in #official-rules. Otherwise, the proposal does not pass. No proposal can be thus resolved before a proposal submitted after it.

- **4 § On The Leader and The Judges**

One player has the position of Leader. After 4 accepted proposals the Leader's term will end. The Leader will then choose their replacement. If the Leader has at least one proposal left to accept, they may accept up to all proposals of that day, even if it is more than the Leader is allowed to accept.

There are two Judges. The player with the highest rank (most exp) is one Judge. The player with the most coins is one Judge. The Leader cannot be a Judge. A Leader is not taken into account for Judge Leaderboards. If a player qualifies for both Judge positions they may choose which of the two they will occupy, and the person next in line in the open position will be the second Judge. 

Whenever a person gets appointed as a Judge for the first time, they get a "Nay" charge. Whenever a Leader's term ends, but not due to Judges' "Nay" vote, each judge gains a "Nay" charge.

An election for a new Leader is automatically triggered and the current Leader is automatically ousted if the current Leader does not fulfill their duties on any given day. That player is marked as Inactive (see 5 §). A Judge can also lose their position if they fails to fulfill their duties on any given day, and is then marked as Inactive (see 5 §). In such a case, the Judge is considered to have voted "Yay" for voting purposes.


- **5 § On Time Limits and Inactive Players**

A player has to complete all mandated actions before the end of the next day (always 17:00 CET) unless stated otherwise.

If a player doesn’t fulfill an obligation compelled by the rules within the time granted for it, they are considered Inactive. Inactive players will be given the "Inactive" role, they will be removed from the turn order in #turns (thus their proposal turns will be skipped) and they do not have access to the #rule-voting channel. Players who comply with this rule are considered Active.

A player tagged as "Inactive" can make a request to become active again in the #nomic-discussion channel. Upon doing so, they are considered active again and are added in last place in #turns.


- **6 § On Points**

The first player to reach 1000 points wins the game. A player winning does not end the game.


- **7 § Transitional Arrangements**

The Constitution completely replaces Rule 1, Rule 2, Rule 3, Rule 5, Rule 8 and Rule 13.

- **8 §** ((Informally named Github amendment))
The function of the discord channels "official-rules", "inventory", "the-constitution", "shop", and "rule-graveyard" shall be migrated to the Infinite Nomic github under files of the same name. 

These files will continue to be referred to as "channels", and can be updated by either their relevant owners, or any users designated as Archivists. A user becomes designated as an Archivist by being a collaborator in the github repository.

To be added as a collaborator, a player may forgo making a proposal to nominate themselves as a Archivist, and initiate a special election. This special election is added to the voting channel immediately. If over 75% of the votes are in favor by the end of the next day, the player will be added as a collaborator.

If a user becomes the owner of a specific channel, such as "shop", they may ask to be added as a collaborator without requiring a special election.
