(Striked through rules are indented as this file does not support striking text)

- **Rule 2** 
When a proposal is made in #proposals, a @Moderator will add it to #voting. If the rule has more votes for than against after 48 hours of it being in #voting, it will be added to #official-rules (or other appropriate thing will happen) and it will have an immediate effect from then on.


- **Rule 3**
The first player to reach 1000 points, wins the game.

- **Rule 6:**
Every time a rule (which is numbered with a number that can be divided by 10 without resulting in a number with decimals) is added to #official-rules, all active players are given a TripleVote. A TripleVote can be used by telling a @Moderator, and upon being used, the next vote of the player whose TripleVote was used, counts as 3 votes. 


- **Rule 7:**
After a player's proposal passes, they receive 40 Coins.


 - **Rule 8:**
 There are always two turns occuring simultaneously from the next two players (after this proposal passes) found in the turn order in #turns. When one of those turns comes to an end, the next player in #turns  begins their turn.


- **Rule 9:**
Whenever a proposal is accepted (adding of a rule, removal of a rule or ammendment of a rule), all the players who voted *against* the proposal receive 10 Coins.


- **Rule 10:**
The players have the option to start a debate. A debate is a time period of 24 hours where people argue for or against the initial argument. For example: "debate: chem trails make frogs gay". Then, people argue for or against it. When the 24 hours are up, people will have new insight concerning both sides, and thus vote for a side. The winners' side will be rewarded 50 Coins to each player who participated, and the losers side will be rewarded 20 (for participation). However, to avoid side switching, I suggest not creating a poll, but rather messaging a mod with the side the player sided with. The debates may be about anything. The debate needs 4 or more participants before the 24 hour time period is over, or else voting won't commence. To qualify as a participant you need to come with at least 1 argument. An argument may be as little as the player simply disagreeing, but the player will need to have some sort of counter-argument. For example: "argument: chem trails doesnt make the frogs gay. What're your sources?" could be a counter argument.


- **Rule 11:**
As soon as this proposal passes an election will happen for a leader. All future changes to the rules (i.e rule amendments, rule deletions, or rule additions) are submitted to the leader to immediately reject or pass on to voting phase.
After 4 accepted proposals the leader's term will end. The leader will then  choose their replacement.
There is also two roles called Judge. The player with the highest rank (most exp) is one Judge. The player with the most Coins is one Judge.


- **Rule 14:**
If a player has 100 Coins or more they have the option of attempting to bribe another player to vote the same as the bribing player on a rule vote. If the potential bribed player accepts the bribe they will gain 100 Coins and the briber will lose 100 Coins.

- **Rule 16:**
You may consume (gain -1) balloon. If you do, move to the first position in the "Next" section of the turn order listed in #turns. Consuming balloons in such a fashion can be done by pinging a @Moderator in the #nomic-discussion channel, and specifically requesting to consume a balloon to "move to the top of the turns order".
You cannot have a negative value of balloons.
EDIT: If a person takes 3 turns without a turn of another person between those turns then their next turn will be skipped.


- **Rule 17: Economy**
All players who have a negative amount of points immediately have 100 points when this proposal passes. 

Everyone lose all their TripleVotes and balloons. Rule 15 is removed from the game by getting a strikethrough. 
Balloons and TripleVotes will still be a thing, but they can be achieved in new ways (see paragraph 12 of this rule). 

The game word "points" will hereby be reffered to as "Coins" instead. 
 
A new channel will be added to the server when this proposal passes, called #shop. Only people with the @Moderator or @Merchant roles can write in this channel. The channel will be an overview of all items it is possible to buy in the game. 

Proposals can define a new item that is added to the #shop. Proposing a new #shop item must include these three things: an item name, a price for buying it, an amount of the item that will be put into the #shop, and an effect the item has upon being used (consuming an owned item can be done by messaging a @Moderator). 
Once such a proposal passes, a @Moderator or a @Merchant will add it to the list of #shop items, using this template: 
[Name]
Cost: [Cost] 
In stock: [Quantity] 
Effect: [Effect]
Each time an item is bought, the item's number in the "in stock" section is decreased by 1. An item can not be bought if this number is lower than 1. 

When this proposal passes, an election will happen where a @Merchant is chosen (someone @Inactive can never be a @Merchant. If the @Merchant becomes inactive or loses the Merchant role in any other way, a new election will be initiated). 

When a new item is proposed, the @Merchant will vote in place of the @Leader. 
Judges are not allowed to vote "Nay" on #shop item proposals. 


If a player wishes to buy something from the #shop, they may choose to message a @Merchant publicly saying explicitly that they wish to buy an item, including the name of the bought item. It is impossible to buy an item if the player does not have an amount of Coins equal to or greater than the price of the requested item, except if the item's description states otherwise. 

All Coins that are spent on buying items from the #shop are not simply removed from the game - they are instead put into the Bank (a section in #shop showing an amount of Coins). This action will be performed by the @Merchant. 


- **Rule 18:**
You may become inactive whenever you like by using the command !inactive. While you are Inactive, if you would like to become active again, you can use the command !active to remove the Inactive role.


- **Rule 19: Vassals & Lords**
Effective with this rule, each player gains a property, Allegiance, that is initially set to “Free.”

A player (hereafter “the vassal”) may swear themselves to another player (hereafter “the lord”) if the lord assents. To do so, the vassal and the lord each message a moderator indicating their intentions, whereupon the vassal’s Allegiance becomes “Lord <lord’s nickname>.” (e.g. “Lord Raven James”)

A vassal may only have one lord, but a lord may have any number of vassals.

In this allegiance, the lord gains coin, while the vassal gains clout. When a vassal makes a proposal that goes to an open vote, the lord must vote there in favor of the proposal. When a vassal gains coins, they must give one tenth of those coins, rounded up, to their lord.

Either player may unilaterally annul the allegiance by (a) failing to perform their duty of allegiance or (b) messaging a moderator indicating their intent. In addition to these, the vassal may annul the allegiance by swearing allegiance to new lord.


- **Rule 20:**
If a player spots an unconstitutional incident and notifies players on #nomic-discussion  about it, specifying the specific parts of the rules that make it unconstitutional, he/she gains 150 points if what he specified is deemed unconstitutional by a @Moderator . 

If a player makes an action while it is deemed unconstitutional, he/she loses 150 points.
Deeming an incident as unconstitutional is made after 3 people, including at least 1 @Moderator agree that the specified incident is unconstitutional.

Modifying a rule that an action is related to, triggers a "constitutional check". A constitutional check, is checking if a previously-related-to-an-unconsitutional-incident-but-now-modified rule can still trigger the unconstitutional incident. If it doesn't, the action is no longer deemed as unconstitutional.

- **Rule 21:**
Every Monday when a @Moderator updates the game (currently 17:00 CET), every player loses 40 (?) Coins each. If they have fewer than 40 Coins when tax is to be collected this day, they will instead lose all their Coins be put at the bottom of the "Next" section of #turns. All Coins collected because of this rule are added to the "Bank" section in #shop by a @Merchant.

- **Rule 22: Redistribution of wealth:**
Every Tuesday, when a @Moderator updates the game, 10% of the coins currently in the bank (rounded up), are split equally among every active player who does not have the most amount of coins.
Any coins that cannot be split equally, return to the bank

For example, 3 active players on a Tuesday with 185 gold in the bank: 19 coins would be split among the 2 active players with the least amount of money. However, since we cannot have half a coin, each of these 2 players gets 9 coins and the bank loses 18 coins to a new total of 167 gold.
If 2 or more players tie for the highest amount of coins, none of these players would get any coins.

- **Rule 23:**
Proposals have ID numbers. Whenever a player submits a proposal to #proposals, they shall label it with its ID number. Each proposal's ID number is the last proposal's ID number plus one.
