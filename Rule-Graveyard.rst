 - **Rule 1**
 Players take turns adding a proposal to the game. A proposal can be changing an existing rule, deleting an existing rule, or making a completely new rule. You may only make 1 proposal on your turn. 
 The player(s) whose turn it is can be found in #turns. 
 Rule 1 EDIT: The player whose turn it is must make a proposal within 24 hours. 
 
 
 - **Rule 2** 
 When a proposal is made in #proposals, a @Moderator will add it to #voting. If the rule has more votes for than against after 48 hours of it being in #voting, it will be added to #official-rules (or other appropriate thing will happen) and it will have an immediate effect from then on.
 
 

 - **Rule 3**
 The first player to reach 1000 points, wins the game.
 
 
- **Rule 4:**
Everyone must react to #memes posts with :ok_hand:.


- **Rule 5:** 
New rule with the following:
By default, all obligations (eg. rules with the formula of "must X") are to be fulfilled within 48 hours of the first moment that the obligation is able to be completed. If a player doesn’t fulfill an obligation compelled by the rules within the time granted for it, their next turn is skipped, other rules about turn order notwithstanding.


 - **Rule 8:**
 There are always two turns occuring simultaneously from the next two players (after this proposal passes) found in the turn order in #turns. When one of those turns comes to an end, the next player in #turns  begins their turn.


- **Rule 11:**
As soon as this proposal passes an election will happen for a leader. All future changes to the rules (i.e rule amendments, rule deletions, or rule additions) are submitted to the leader to immediately reject or pass on to voting phase.
After 4 accepted proposals the leader's term will end. The leader will then  choose their replacement.
There is also two roles called Judge. The player with the highest rank (most exp) is one Judge. The player with the most Coins is one Judge.


- **Rule 12:**
If someone’s rule does not pass, they will be deducted 40 Coins.

- **Rule 13:**
 After the leader has chosen to pass a rule, but before it is to be voted by all the Active players, the Judges get to vote "Yay" or "Nay" in the passed rule. To vote for a "Nay" they have to consume a "Nay" charge. The judge vote is secret, and is submitted to a Moderator. If they both vote "Nay", the current leader's term immediately ends, the change to the rules is not implemented, an election happens for a new leader, and the leader who lost his position loses 200 points. 
 A player cannot be both a leader and a judge. A Leader is not taken into account for Judge Leaderboards. If a player qualifies for both judge positions he may choose which of the two they will occupy, and the person next in line in the position he has not occupied will be the second judge.
 Whenever a person gets appointed as a Judge for the first time, they get a "Nay" charge. Whenever a Leader's term ends, but not due to Judges' "Nay" vote, each judge gains a "Nay" charge.
 An election for a new leader is automatically triggered and the current leader is automatically ousted if the current leader does not fulfill their duties within 24 hours and is marked as Inactive (just if marked as inactive under Rule #5) A judge can also lose his position if he fails to vote within 24 hours, and is marked as inactive (just as if marked as inactive due to Rule #5). In such a case, the Judge is considered to have voted "Yay" for his voting purposes.

- **Rule 15:**
You may at any time spend 50 Coins (gain -50 Coins) to buy a balloon.

- **Rule 24:**
Relegate strikethrough'd proposals to a new channel titled #mask-archives.
